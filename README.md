# Deep Learning with Keras (On going) - Python 3 version

This repository contains my personal experimentation on Deep Learning; for which, I have a great passion.

- Following are useful sites:
    - Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/
    - Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/ (which also contains a great tutorial on Tensorflow and Keras)
    - Keras: https://keras.io/
